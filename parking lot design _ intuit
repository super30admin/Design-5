Declaration:
PriorityQueue of tuple <parkinglotId,distance> arranged as per distance.
HashSet<parkingLotId> // this is for checking what all spaces are filled.

Approach:

Initially, put tuple <parkingLotId,distance> of all the parking lot in a priority queue arranged as per distance.
Now, 
As and when a new car enters, pop an elementfrom the priority queue.
At the same time, put this poped tuples parkingId in the HashSet.

As and when a car leaves the parking lot, insert the tuple <parkingLotId,dstance> in the PriorityQueue.
At the same time, remove the parkingLotId  from the hashset.

Time Complexity:
log(n) --> for each entry.
log(n) --> for each exit.
finding if a space is occupied --> O(1).
