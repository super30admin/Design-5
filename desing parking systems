// Key datastructure used here is min heap because of the given condition nearest to gate must be first so based on heap property when
//any car enters then it can only be logn . And for storing car place we can use a hashmap of carnumber and slot number.
//Time complexity:- O(logn).
//Spacecomplexity:-O(2N).
